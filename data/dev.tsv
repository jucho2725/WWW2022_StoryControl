In order to not violate the law and be added to the blacklist of the bounty hunters he provokes them to pull out their weapon first. Then he has a reason to act in selfdefense and shoot them. But Loco does not let himself be provoked. Not until after he lures the new sheriff – who had been given the impossible task by the governor to reestablish order in the region and to grant amnesty to those starving in the mountains – to his death does Loco face up to the final fight with Silence The film is famous for its bleak ending a bloody scene in which the sympathetic characters are gunned down by the greedy bounty hunters all according to the law as Loco comments. The director was forced to shoot an alternate ending for the North African and Asian markets where the hero's death in the end would have been deemed unacceptable. The Fantoma DVD features the alternative happy ending without sound. The comic sheriff played by Frank Wolff returns from the dead to save the day.

Satirising the American Western genre Lemonade Joe is a cleanliving gunfighter who drinks only Kolaloka lemonade and takes on a town full of whiskeydrinking cowboys. It is a musical comedy parodying the old silent westerns with color tinting and sped up fight scenes including the obligatory breaking banister. What's good for Kolaloka is good for the law! says one of the characters and by the end of the film both villains and heroes learn to work together for the sake of business mdash i.e. the Kolaloka company whose name is obviously based on Coca Cola. As the film progresses it becomes clearer that Joe doesn't just clean up the town for morality's sake but because he wants whiskey out of the way. One of the subplots involves the arrival of an evangelist in the town with his daughter. Although the evangelist doesn't seem to be working purely for financial motives he is both contrasted and likened to Joe in his techniques. The film's main theme is the continuing controversy of interconnection of big business and government in society. While some would see this as necessary and good others think the opposite hence the film's opinions on large scale American marketing campaigns such as Coca Cola's are embodied in Joe's ambiguity as a character... is he an all American hero or just a shameless shill and coward Likewise Joe's love interests are torn between the dark haired beauty who works in the bawdyhouse and the clean living blonde evangelist's daughter. Initially he is more interested in the latter especially as she is involved in a temperance campaign which would be good for his Kolaloka franchise business.	western	1964.0	Lemonade Joe	"{""/m/01mk6"": ""Czechoslovakia"", ""/m/01mjq"": ""Czech Republic""}"	360

Eti is more like a routine love story where a bunch of collegegoers get together play pranks and make merry but are caught unawares — or rather with their pants down — by the subsequent twists and turns. By the end of it Eti becomes a complex story too simply told. At the centre of all the action is Gourab who plays the super cool Sanjoy in love with Shreya . The couple along with two other couples and a stillsingle friend plan a holiday in Darjeeling. The gang of friends is meant to have a blast on the road but the foolish gags and lukewarm dialogues slacken the pace. Gourab and Shreya get cosy and make the mistake of recording their intimate moments on a handycam. The sequence is candidly filmed with Gourab caressing Roopalis bare back as they make love on satin sheets. But the director does desist from turning the film into a sleaze fest.What had started off as a teen romance changes track postinterval. Things take an ugly turn when the teenagers get sucked into a porn racket. A giggling squealing Roopali takes time to get under the skin of her character. Gourab does better as a mischievous funloving youth except for the times when he bursts into tears as things go awry. Of the rest Bhaswar tries to be the friendphilosopherguide to his pals his bright and chirpy lady love Sweta livens up things a bit. Swaralipi fits in as a silly romantic while Dhruv the guy without a girlfriend is hardly funny.But the waferthin plot struggling to hold the chain of sensational events takes a toll on the film. The pedestrian treatment does not help matters. Digitally shot Eti has the feel of a home video with shoddy editing and jerky camera movements.	romance	2008.0	Eti	"{""/m/03rk0"": ""India""}"	410

The first difficulty is that the students from the provinces all speak different regional languages and dialects and the first task is to teach them all to speak a standardised Parisian French. After a few years of indifference the schools first aims prove impossible to attain. An important crisis arises from a performance by the students of an extract from Iphigenie by Racine. This provokes too much passion among the actors and so Madame de Maintenon asks Racine to write her a play for her students that praises virtue – this proves to be Esther. The students put on the new play and when the king and his court attend the production Madame de Maintenon realises that this had made the nobles of the court view her protégées as targets for seduction and marriage. Marriage proposals mount up and one nobleman even manages to break into the school. Madame de Maintenon decides to impose stricter rules and plunges into religion in an attempt to expiate her past. She asks an abbot to help her keep students on the right Christian moral path and keep them safe from the world. Instead of turning its students into an elite for the world outside the school falls prey to realities cuts itself off from reality and falls apart – the film ends with its final failure and closure.	romance	2000.0	The King's Daughters	"{""/m/0f8l9c"": ""France"", ""/m/0154j"": ""Belgium"", ""/m/0345h"": ""Germany""}"	325
