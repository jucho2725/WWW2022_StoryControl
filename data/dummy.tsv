In an attempt to trace her missing husband Julie has employed a private detective who discovered evidence implicating Richard of involvement with another woman and more seriously the private detective has recently been found murdered. Richard enlists Julie's help in trying to recover his memory of the peculiar goingson of which he has no recollection. He soon becomes aware that he is being trailed by a group of mysterious men. Meanwhile in his confused mental state he is constantly tantalised by seemingly random and trivial things – a snatch of a popular song or a conversational nuance – which seem to strike a chord with him for reasons for which he cannot account. He starts to experience flashbacks so momentary and fleeting that they are gone before his conscious mind can seize them. He begins to question the validity of the assumptions under which he is working wondering if he may indeed have been involved in criminal activity which his mind has blocked out as a defence mechanism and even begins to doubt Julie's integrity questioning whether she may have far more knowledge of and personal involvement in what has been happening than she is letting on. Matters reach a head when he is lured to a country house and confronts a group of men in possession of a bomb. The resulting intrigue finally appears to jolt his memory back into place and he believes he has found the explanation for what has been going on.	thriller	1961.0	Pit of Darkness	British	431
