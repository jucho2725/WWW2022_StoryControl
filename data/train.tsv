The movie flips between following a group of gamers in a dorm immersed in a roleplaying game and their characters as they journey through a world of fantasy and wonder to defeat a being known as The Shadow and rescue a princess. The latter is theoretically a heroic quest but while the game master attempts to foster in a narrative the players tend to be more interested in their characters' tolerance for ale trying to apply the sneak attack damage multiplier to siege weaponry et cetera. The movie both makes fun of gamer stereotypes and plays the discrepancy between an optimal RPG plot and the events of an actual RPG session for maximum absurdity. Characters attempting something dangerous freeze as dice clatter in the distance. The party thief picks the pocket of a bystander then steals that bystander's pants  not because he wants the pants in any way but solely to see if his skill statistics allow it. When an unlucky dice roll causes the death of one character the other players' characters mourn him for a moment and then immediately start squabbling over the items he was carrying. Characters spring to action then keel over as their players forget and are reminded that the characters are asleep players argue and make snack runs and their game is frequently interrupted by a girl from the same dorm who demands they keep quiet so that she can study. The Shadow is eventually defeated after a long quest and the characters find themselves in a strange tunnel. On the other side of the door they hear voices—the voices of their players who are narrating the action in the hallway outside. Bursting into the room  the characters slaughter the gamers then begin picking over the room for treasure. Discovering that their entire adventure has been documented by the 'strange sorcerers' they've just slain they discover their character sheets .

Waking Life is about an unnamed young man living an ethereal existence that lacks transitions between everyday events and that eventually progresses to a state of selfreflective lucidity. For most of the film he observes quietly but later participates actively in philosophical discussions involving other characters—ranging from quirky scholars and artists to everyday restaurantgoers and friends—about such issues as metaphysics free will social philosophy and the meaning of life. Other scenes do not even include the protagonist's presence but rather show an isolated person or couple speaking about such topics from a disembodied perspective. Along the way the film touches also upon existentialism situationist politics posthumanity the film theory of André Bazin and lucid dreaming and makes references to various celebrated intellectual and literary figures by name. Gradually the protagonist realizes that he is living out a perpetual dream broken up only by occasional false awakenings. So far he is mostly a passive onlooker though this changes during a chat with a woman. After she eccentrically greets and shares her creative ideas with him he reminds himself of his recent realization and of the fact that she must therefore be a figment of his own dreaming imagination. Afterwards he starts to converse more openly with other dream characters as well however he ultimately begins to despair about being utterly trapped in this unending irresolvable state of existence. The protagonist's final talk is with a character who looks somewhat similar to the protagonist himself and whom he briefly encountered previously earlier on in the film. This last conversation reveals this other character's understanding that reality may be only a single instant that the individual interprets falsely as time  that living is simply the individual's constant negation of God's invitation to become one with the universe that dreams offer a glimpse into the infinite nature of reality and that in order to be free from the illusion called life the individual need only to accept God's invitation though he does not explicitly explain how this is achieved. The protagonist is last seen walking into a driveway when he suddenly begins to levitate paralleling a scene at the start of the film of a floating child in the same driveway. Unlike the child who grabbed firmly onto the handle of a nearby car however the protagonist uncertainly reaches toward the same handle but is too swiftly lifted above the vehicle and over the trees. He now rises into the endless blue expanse of the sky until he disappears from view altogether.	fantasy	2001.0	Waking Life	"{""/m/09c7w0"": ""United States of America""}"	505

The plot revolves around a young boy named Travis who learns from his master that he is the key to saving the world from an evil plot. Tee joins the secret organization of the Delta Knights and embarks on a quest to attempt to recover the lost treasures inside the fabled Lost Storehouse of Archimedes. The plot is markedly similar to that of Robert Heinlein's Citizen of the Galaxy including its essentially identical setup of a young slave boy—who is really the lost heir of a powerful family—being bought for a pittance by a seeming beggar who is himself really a spy and who suspects the boy's true identity. The cinematic accomplishments of the movie are decidedly meager such as the completely unexplained casting of David Warner as both the hero's mentor and the chief villain in addition to providing the narration. The dialogue is decidedly campy and the movie has a definite lowbudget atmosphere. Also noteworthy is the extreme confusion the film displays with regard to setting both in terms of time period and location. The story would seem to take place in medieval England however a number of plot elements contradict this. Vultare's henchmen wear headgear strongly resembling Viking helmets. Leonardo da Vinci a figure from Renaissance Italy appears as a major character in the plot. Finally Leonardo and Tee are searching for the lost storehouse of Archimedes a figure from ancient Syracuse Sicily whose storehouse one might reasonably think unlikely to be found in England. A document held by Archimedes seen in a flashback is also clearly held together by staples. A large portion of this movie was filmed at the Renaissance Pleasure Faire in Black Point Novato California. Performers from the Faire were employed as extras in various scenes throughout. Exterior scenes of Archimedes' storehouse were filmed at the Palace of Fine Arts San Francisco California. Exterior scenes of the prison were filmed at Petaluma Adobe State Park Petaluma California. Some interior scenes of the Mannerjay's palace were filmed at the Scottish Rite Temple Oakland California. The opening theme is a reuse of the theme from the 1980 science fiction film Battle Beyond the Stars.	fantasy	1993.0	Quest of the Delta Knights	"{""/m/09c7w0"": ""United States of America""}"	451

The huge kingdom of Takicardia is ruled by a king under the unwieldy title of Charles V  III XVI. Hes a heartless ruler hated by his people as much as he hates them. The king is fond of hunting but is unfortunately crosseyed – not that anyone would dare acknowledge this in front of him as the numerous statues and paintings that adorn the palace and the land show. Occasionally the king does hit his target though notably the wife of the bird known only as l'Oiseau the narrator of the story who takes pleasure in taunting the terrible king at every opportunity. In his secret apartment the king dreams of the beautiful shepherdess whose painting he keeps on his wall but the shepherdess is in love with the chimney sweep whose hated portrait is on the opposite wall. At night the paintings come to life and attempt to escape from the palace but are pursued by a noncrosseyed painting of the king that also has come to life deposed the real king and has taken his place. He orders the capture of the shepherdess and the sweep but the bird is there to help when called upon. They are pursued to the depths of the Lower City where the inhabitants have never seen the light of the sun and strange creatures including batpolice take up their chase. {{see}} Only the early scene in the secret apartment is based on The Shepherdess and the Chimney Sweep while the rest of the movie focuses much more on the king and the bird hence the ultimate title. In Andersen's tale the shepherdess and the chimney sweep are china figurines rather than paintings and a wooden satyr wishes to wed the shepherdess supported by a Chinaman rather than a king and a classical statue. In both tales the Chinamanstatue breaks and the duo escape up the chimney and delight in celestial bodies but in Andersen's tale the shepherdess is afraid of the wide world and the duo return this is echoed in the movie where the statue predicts that they will return.	fantasy	1952.0	Le Roi et l'oiseau	"{""/m/0f8l9c"": ""France""}"	436

On 12 July a shark was sighted swimming into the freshwater canal of Matawan Creek—one expert who had come to capture the animal speculated that this indicated a bull shark.

After the shark was finally captured offshore an autopsy was performed and it is said that 15 pounds of human flesh with bones were found in its stomach.

A scholarly dissertation on the appearances of demons and witches in primitive and medieval culture a number of photographs of statuary paintings and woodcuts are used as demonstrative pieces. In addition several large scale models are employed to demonstrate medieval concepts of the structure of the solar system and the commonly accepted depiction of Hell. A series of vignettes theatrically demonstrating medieval superstition and beliefs concerning witchcraft including Satan tempting a sleeping woman away from her husband's bed and terrorizing a group of monks. Also shown is a woman purchasing a love potion from a supposed witch and a sequence showing a supposed witch dreaming of flying through the air and attending a witches' gathering. A long narrative broken up into several parts set in the Middle Ages it concerns an old woman accused of witchcraft by a dying man's family. The narrative is used to demonstrate the treatment of suspected witches by the religious authorities of the time. The old woman after being tortured admits to heavy involvement in witchcraft including detailed descriptions of a Witches' Sabbath even going so far as to name other supposed witches including two of the women in the dying man's household. Eventually the dying man's wife is arrested as a witch when she admits that she falsely accused the old woman of witchcraft. The final part of the film seeks to demonstrate how the superstitions of old are better understood now. Christensen seeks to make the claim that most who were accused of witchcraft were possibly mentally ill and in modern times such behavior is interpreted as a disease. His case revolves around vignettes about a somnambulist and a kleptomaniac the implication being that these behaviors would have been thought of as demonicallyinfluenced in medieval times whereas modern times recognizes them as psychological ailments. There is heavy irony however in the observation that the temperate shower of the clinic i.e. the treatment of hysterical women in a modern institution has replaced medieval solutions such as burning at the stake.	fantasy	1923.0	Häxan	"{""/m/0k6nt"": ""Denmark"", ""/m/0d0vqn"": ""Sweden""}"	416

The film is based on the story The Curse of Capistrano written by Johnston McCulley originally published in 1919 which introduced the masked hero Zorro. The story is set in Southern California during the early 19th century. The plot deals with Don Diego Vega  the apparently foppish son of wealthy ranchero Don Alejandro Vega  who returns to California after his education in Spain. He is horrified at the way the common people are mistreated by alcalde Luis Quintero . Don Diego adopts the guise of El Zorro  a masked outlaw who becomes the defender of the common people. Meanwhile he romances the Alcalde's beautiful niece Lolita . He simultaneously flirts with the Alcalde's wife Inez  filling her head with tales of Madrid fashion and culture and raising her desire to move there with her corrupt husband. In both his guises Don Diego has to contend with the governor's ablest henchman the malevolent Captain Pasquale . The film features a climactic duel between Zorro and Pasquale. Rathbone was known already in Hollywood as an outstanding classical fencer but Power's own excellent skills are displayed here for the first time. The duel is ornate and full of subtlety as opposed to Rathbone's duel with Errol Flynn in The Adventures of Robin Hood and the duel in The Mark of Zorro is considered by many movie buffs{{weaselinline}} Staged by Hollywood's resident fencing master Fred Cavens and atmospherically shot by cinematographer Arthur Miller and director Rouben Mamoulian the scene takes place in a single room and forces actors to fight rather than jump around in the scenery. In key shots Cavens' son Albert doubles for Power . Scenes of fast fencing were undercranked to 1820 frames per second requiring that all the sound for the scene be postsynchronized. Rathbone suffered two scratches on his forehead during its filming and later said of Power He could fence Errol Flynn into a cocked hat.	western	1940.0	The Mark of Zorro	"{""/m/09c7w0"": ""United States of America""}"	431

The central figure of the film is represented by a mysterious figure called Gaja Gamini  who inspires arouses and confuses the common man. Gaja Gamini is the inspiration behind Leonardo Da Vinci's 'Mona Lisa' Kalidas' poem Shakuntala and a photojournalist named Shahrukh's photographs. The mysterious Gaja Gamini appears as four characters one of them being Sangeeta a blind girl from Banaras at the beginning of time who inspires village women to revolt against a maledominated system and carve a niche for women forever. Another character is Shakuntala who is the subject of Kalidas' poem of the same name. Shakuntala incites jealousy in the women and love in the men around her charming humans and animals alike in the forests of Kerala. Gaja Gamini is also Mona Lisa during the Renaissance the object of painter Leonardo Da Vinci's obsession. Finally Monika the most confusing sector of the film is supposed to represent the woman of the New Millennium. Kamdev the God of Love  walks the earth throughout history attempting to win the love of Gaja Gamini. Thrown into this mix is a large black wall separating two different time periods and confrontations between Science and Art at different points in history showing that the world itself can change but its original ideas will always be the same. For example a play by Shakespeare written and performed by actors in the 15th Century will still be performed in the 21st Century but with different actors. The confrontations between Art and Science also bring about the idea that while Science is firmly set on believing that which can only be proved the basis for Art is that which can be proved and an intuitive sense that can be felt. Science uses the brain while Art uses the brain and the heart. Another interesting facet of the film is a gathri a small bundle which a woman carries upon her head like a burden with which she must walk forever.The Paradox of Progress II Gaja GaminiGaja Gamini Yahoo!

The 1998 film directed by Paul McGuigan dramatises three stories from the book  The Granton Star Cause is a comedy where Boab is having a very bad day indeed. His parents throw him out so they can indulge in sadomasochism and he is sacked from his job dumped by his girlfriend and dropped from his football team. It has elements of Franz Kafka's The Metamorphosis. One of the characters is a pitiless and profane God who transforms him into a fly as punishment for wasting his life.  A Soft Touch Kevin McKidd plays a cuckolded husband while Gary McCormack is Larry the ruthless upstairs neighbour who steals his electricity and his wife played by Michelle Gomez.  The Acid House An acid trip and a bolt of lightning result in amiable schemie Coco Brice exchanging bodies with the baby of a middle class couple. All three sections are independent but are linked by setting and by the reappearance of incidental characters in particular Maurice Roëves who appears variously as an inebriated wedding guest a figure in a dream and a pub patron. All three of his parts symbolise a human manifestation of God. The film offended elements of the UK tabloid press with a depiction of a cynical and jaded foulmouthed God. In some Englishspeaking countries it has been screened with subtitles because of the heavy Edinburgh accents.	fantasy	1998.0	The Acid House	"{""/m/014tss"": ""Kingdom of Great Britain"", ""/m/07ssc"": ""United Kingdom""}"	293

A dark comingofage film Samson follows its Jewish protagonist from an antiSemitic private school to a prison then into a Jewish ghetto and finally over the ghetto wall to the outside world. Wajda uses this journey as a means to explore expressionist cinematography and the weighty issues facing the Jewish people. The construction of the Jewish ghetto is communicated through a single stationary shot. A shabbily dressed mass is clustered in front of the camera and a pair of hands with a hammer and nails secures one board at a time until the shot of people has been replaced with a shot of a wall. Through minimalism and simplicity Wadja establishes a separation between the world of the impoverished Jew and the world outside the ghetto. The viewer looking on as the ghetto walls block the view of what happening inside is made to feel detached from the horror inside. One question Wajda raises is that of Jewish solidarity and the guilt of being saved while one's brethren are suffering. Samson escapes from the Jewish ghetto but immediately wants to return. Although he could enjoy a comfortable life of cocktails and women he'd rather be in the ghetto collecting corpses off the streets. Samson argues that his place is with the Jews that he should suffer alongside them. A fakeblond beauty offers a different take. She confides to Samson that she's Jewish and has been concealing her roots in order to avoid the ghetto. Although she argues passionately Samson's emotional strength inevitably inspires her to accept her fate as a Jew. When Samson is bruised and exhausted lying on the ground he is encouraged by a close friend who says “one man can suffer such blows and rise again.” For Wajda this is the greatness displayed in Jewish history. Samson is a scrawny haggard young man who says very little and might almost border on boringly average but he has the ability to rise again despite any blow proving his strength of spirit.	romance	1961.0	Samson	"{""/m/05qhw"": ""Poland""}"	408

After Emily attempts to negotiate Mara knocks her out and Ariel shoots Mara with Emily's gun. Ariel comments that sometimes an evil deed has a partially good result.

The story opens with Wong Chi Hang fleeing the Hong Kong police who are after him for murder. He winds up in Macau where he takes a job as a cook at the 8 Immortals restaurant. After getting busted for cheating at a game of Mah Jong Wong kills the owner and the family taking over the restaurant himself. Meanwhile the police led by officer Lee are called out to a local beach. It seems that a bag of decomposing body parts has washed ashore. The police begin to suspect Wong has both something to do with the washed up body parts and the disappearance of the family. Wong continues to gleefully murder any of his employees who suspect what might be going on . . . disposing of their bodies in a most interesting way. Wong is captured near the middle of the film and placed in jail. The cops need a confession so they place him in a cell with a relative of one of his victims in the hopes that he can beat it out of Wong. The prison scenes are just as disturbing as the murders that have occurred earlier in the film — perhaps more so. What makes them truly unsettling is not merely the violence but the fact that the viewer begins to sympathize with Wong. It's hard to watch him suffer at the hands of the police and the felons around him and not feel some kind of empathy despite the fact that he's a brutal murderer . . . and therein lies the true strength of this film.	horror	1993.0	Untold Story	"{""/m/03h64"": ""Hong Kong""}"	298

For the first two acts the plot essentially follows the lines of the short story. However in the third act of the film the protagonist Wilmarth uncovers an attempt by collaborators to open a gateway between Yuggoth and Earth. He foils the plot with the help of an added character Hannah the child of one of the collaborators. His escape however is unsuccessful and at the end of the film the audience discovers that Wilmarth has been narrating from a machine attached to the cylinder in which his brain now resides. This differs from the original story in which Wilmarth flees in the middle of the night and safely returns to Arkham. According to Sean Branney on the makingof featurette The Whisperer Behind the Scenes Lovecraft was better at setups than endings. From a dramatic standpoint Lovecraft's story brought the writers through what would be Act Two of a standard movie structure and felt incomplete. The character of Hannah and opening of gate to Yuggoth were introduced in order to  a good movie. Branney and Leman intended to make Wilmarth's world more emotionally complicated because Hannah's future caused him to be invested in more than just himself. The characters of Wilmarth's three friends at Miskatonic University were developed from Call of Cthulhu roleplaying characters created years before by Branney Leman and a friend. Regarding the introduction of a biplane Leman commented If you have monsters that fly you have to have a dogfight with a biplane.The Whisperer in Darkness. Dir. Sean Branney. 2011. DVD.

This original story marries three different elements into one plot. The movie is basically a film noir where a selfdestructive downandout investigator takes on a case that may be more than he can handle. Incorporating standard elements like a beautiful woman excessive drinking and subtle voiceover the piece is set up like a standard detective film. Later a science fiction angle which is part conspiracy and part nouveau alchemy is introduced. This component to some degree extends the common understanding of quantum physics. Within this framework the unbelievable is now possible and the story is set up for special effects and general creepiness. One final ingredient is comedy. Mostly situational the laughs come from the somewhat uncommon characters thrown together in this extraordinary scenario. Rather than punchlines reactions comparisons and slapstick are used to ease the tension and create a more fun atmosphere. Not to be forgotten this is first and foremost a horror movie. Where the film consists of a variety of different genre elements Aversion is simply a suspenseful film of demonic possession.	fantasy	2009.0	Aversion	"{""/m/09c7w0"": ""United States of America""}"	220

Scriptwriter Babu Janardhanan tells it like it is. His stories are hard hitting and mostly based on real life incidents and he tackles the issue head on. Now he has turned director with Malayalam film Bombay March 12 set against the serial bomb blasts that rocked the metropolis in 1993. The film makes the point that a person not even remotely connected with the event can become a victim just because of his name and the religion he believes in. The story is about Sameer  a sweeper with the Alapuzha Municipality who is always on tenterhooks because he is on the police radar whenever there is trouble or an act of terror occurs. Later it is revealed that his brotherinlaw Shahjahan was suspected to be part of the terror team that had planted bombs in Bombay in 1993 and was later killed in an encounter with the Army in Andhra Pradesh. The narrative moves back and forth slowly connecting Sameer with Shahjahan who had gone to Bombay as an IT professional from whom much was expected by his family. The innocent youngster gets entangled in the web of a terror group and goes into hiding fearing the safety of his loved ones. The storytelling is complicated and you need to be focused as every scene exposes yet another layer of the story something Babu Janardhanan did as a writer in the Lijo Jose Pellissery directed City of God recently. But there is always a niggling thought at the back of our minds that the point he is trying to make – that 'one bad egg can spoil the whole basket' – could have been conveyed just as well in a more simple and linear narrative. Mammootty plays one of his most subdued roles in recent times. Roma as his wife Abida may look to be a mismatch for Mammootty but the age difference is justified in the story. Sadiq who appears as Shahjahan's father is the surprise package of the film. Unni Mukundan as Shahjahan has the role of a parallel hero and does full justice to the confidence that the director has reposed in him.	thriller	2011.0	1993 Bombay, March 12	{}	434

{{main}} The film opens with images of Venetian life in 1596 especially discrimination against the Jews. Words on the screen inform the audience about antiSemitism in the period describing the system of the ghetto and Jewish usury. Shylock and Antonio are seen among a crowd watching Jews being thrown from the Rialto Bridge into the canal. Otherwise the film follows the plot of Shakespeare's play closely. There are some significant emendations In Act III scene I Tubal tells Shylock that in Genoa a person showed me a ring that he had of your daughter for a monkey. Shylock replies Thou torturest me Tubal It was my turquoise I had it of Leah when I was a bachelor I would not have given it for a wilderness of monkeys. Nothing more is said of it. However in an added scene at the end of the film there is a closeup shot of the turquoise ring on Jessica's finger implying that Jessica has somewhat remained loyal to her Jewish heritage. Another significant emendation is that we don't see that Antonio receives the good news that three of his ships were not stranded and have returned safely after all at the end of the film.	romance	2004.0	The Merchant of Venice	"{""/m/09c7w0"": ""United States of America"", ""/m/03rjj"": ""Italy"", ""/m/07ssc"": ""United Kingdom"", ""/m/04g61"": ""Luxembourg""}"	262

The film opens with a prelude showing a murderous robbery by the outlaw Clegg family  and his four boys. The credits then follow the prelude which was a stylistic innovation at its time. A Mormon wagon train led by the Elder Wiggs  around 1880 has reached Crystal City and needs a wagon master to lead it further to its destination—the San Juan River country in southeastern Utah Territory. Their wagon train is being expelled from Crystal City by the townspeople there and at the last minute horse traders Travis Blue  and Sandy Owens  take the wagon master job. After resuming its journey west the train finds and adds the wagon of a medicine show troupe who en route to California have become stranded without water. The onward passage of the wagon train is marked by the beginnings of romances between Travis and Denver  a female entertainer with the medicine troupe and between Sandy and a Mormon's daughter and also by a Mormon square dance celebrating a successful desert passage and by a powwow dance with a band of Navajo. All goes well enough until the Cleggs fleeing a posse from Crystal City force themselves into the wagon train. The train surmounts an encounter with the posse a washed out trail blocking the way west and ultimately a violent confrontation with the homicidal Cleggs. The film's conclusion leaves the wagon train and its wagon master on the verge of entry into the San Juan country. There is a final montage which Richard Jameson characterizes as follows Wagon Master has scant interest in the prosaic being preeminently a musical and a poem. ... it's the final montage that lifts the movie into another realm entirely. There are shots we've seen before—landmarks vistas the communal dance—but also shots we haven't. ... It's a subtler deeper variation on the closing transfiguring memory images of How Green Was My Valley .	western	1950.0	Wagon Master	American	449

Allegedly based on a true incident reported on page 7 of a local newspaper the film was a scathing satire on the corruption in the judicial system and the victimization of the underprivileged by the able and the powerful. Aakrosh forms a part of the series of works based around explorations in violence written by noted playwright Vijay Tendulkar who had earlier written Shyam Benegal's Nishant  and went to write Govind Nihalani's next surprise breakaway hit Ardh Satya . Here the victim is shown so traumatized by excessive oppression and violation of his humanity that he does not utter a single word almost for the length of the film and only bears a stunned look though later he uses the same violence as a tool to express his own sense of violation and rage. Basically the story is of a peasant who is oppressed by landowners and his foremen while trying to eke out a living as a daily laborer. His comely wife played by Smita Patil is raped by the foreman who then has him arrested to hide his own crime. His wife commits suicide out of shame. The police bring him to the funeral grounds in manacles and shackles to complete the Last Rites of his dead father by lighting the funeral pyre — which in the Hindu religion only the son has the right to. Standing beside the burning funeral pyre he sees the foreman looking at his prepubescent sister with lustful eyes. Divining the fate that is in store for her he grabs an axe and chops off his sister's head to forestall her dire future as perpetual victim as he sees it. Upon completion of this hapless act of a desperate and downtrodden man he raises his face towards the skies and screams and screams and screams — the second time that we hear his voice in the movie  — a device similar to Andrei Tarkovsky's showing of the icons in brilliant color at the end of his threehour blackandwhite film Andrei Rublev.	thriller	1980.0	Aakrosh	Bollywood	460
